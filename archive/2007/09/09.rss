		<description>&lt;p&gt;So this month the Rugby World Cup kicks off. I have tickets for all of the England group matches. I intend to blog about my travels to and from the games and indeed the games themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might even waffle on about the other matches as well. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I finished booking my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raileurope.co.uk&quot;&gt;rail tickets&lt;/a&gt; and hotels for the next month. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://booking.com&quot;&gt;booking.com&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accorhotels.com/accorhotels/index.html&quot;&gt;Accor Hotels&lt;/a&gt; website to find some okay deals. Marseille for the quarter finals was the worst. There were no easily findable hotels near the centre of town. Nantes was pretty hard as well booking.com only had one hotel left it would seem but I now have a roof over my head and travel plans for all of the matches I have tickets for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the next month im going to get to know the insides of the Eurostar and the TGVs quite well. Beats flying though. Some of the airplane ticket prices were astronomical already even on the budget airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father is doing most of the world cup in a camper van. I would have joined him but my employers seem to want me to turn up to work.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;While I am going to&amp;nbsp; few games live some of them I will still have to watch on TV with my trusty &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humaxdigital.com/uk/products/pvr-8000t.asp&quot;&gt;PVR&lt;/a&gt; recording the ones I wont be in for.&amp;nbsp; Although I am thinking about upgrading to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humaxdigital.com/uk/products/pvr-9200t.asp&quot;&gt;Humax 9200T&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itv.com/Sport/rugbyworldcup/Fixtures/default.html&quot;&gt;ITV schedule&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; will let you know what times and what channels. Yay for multi-channel TV on Freeview. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Castaign%C3%A8de&quot;&gt;Thomas &lt;/a&gt;Castaign√®de just predicted France to win by 10. Argentina will push France quite hard. I actually think Argentina will win but it will be close.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6976080.stm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So France are in trouble at half time. France 9-17 Argentina. They havent looked that good as well. Although dad thinks they both look better than England.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

                <pubDate>Fri, 7 Sep 2007 22:14:35 +0100</pubDate>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;I was right. Argentina won 17-12. Although they were playing with fire at the end. The french really can be dangerous at the death.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/rjw1/1352567662/in/set-72157601970911630/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1319/1352567662_0d4852b2ae.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;England looked really bad during this game. We really should have beaten them by an awful lot more points. I was talking to a group of USA fans afterwards who agreed that we really should have been beating them by about 60 points at half time. Although given their performance against tonga today the usa may not be all that bad&lt;/p&gt;

                <pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2007 17:09:56 +0100</pubDate>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;A 30 point win by Fiji. Japan may score a try or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fiji are never that great at the 15 man version of the game they should be able to beat Japan easily. Even with their ringers. &lt;/p&gt;

                <pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2007 17:55:17 +0100</pubDate>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong here. Although japan may tire yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im also intrigued by the fijians number 8 at the scrum. He seems to be holding onto his locks and leaning back then pushing forward when they engage. Perhaps it adds to their shove.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well that was an exciting &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6987627.stm&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. Japan were really quite good and pushed Fiji very hard. The Fijians could have been their own worse enemy at the end there. They had at least 2 chances to kick to touch which they missed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Italy should be good enough these days to beat Romania but given some of the other matches so far this tournament i don&#39;t know.&amp;nbsp; I predict a 20 point win for Italy. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Quite dull so far especially when compared to the previous game. Italy look the better side but arnt making the best use of their possession. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;A better game in the second half.&amp;nbsp; Italy should have done better though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made it to paris on the eurostar. Finally found my hotel. Sitting at a cafe outside the gare du nord. Having a beer while waiting for dad. &lt;br/&gt;England are going to get thumped i think. That or we sneak by it by 2 points.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well thats not going well. When it was still 10 - 0 we had a chance. That last try was a killer blow I suspect. Although we didnt look as bad as last week and they have only really scored from broken play.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well that was crap. England looked better but had no penetration. Hopefully jason robinson isnt to badly injured. The south africans looked really good although they only scored from broken play. &lt;br/&gt;the atmosphere at the ground was really good. The stadium is very impressive. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently sitting on a TGV between Paris and Nantes. Its really quite full. I was lucky on the eurostar as I got 2 seats to myself. The connection across Paris was a bit close. It is probably worth prebuying your Metro tickets at the eurostar terminal in london and knowing which metro line you want. In this case line 4 &quot;the pink one&quot; between Gare du Nord and Montparnasse. The walk from the tube to the train is quite long.&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully i can find somewhere to watch tonights crunch match between France and Ireland. I suspect France will win.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Ive not had a chance to watch any matches this week. Work sent me to Utrecht. The dutch dont seem to show rugby matches in their bars. Ive not even been able to keep up with the cricket.  So I&#39;ve had nothing to blog about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a post in my head about the first weekend and the interesting things which happened but work and real life keep on getting in the way of writing it. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Caught the last 20 minutes of this game in a bar full of french supporters. France looked awesome. Obviously the loss to Argentina was the kick in the arse they needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missed the start since I was having a really nice dinner. Post to follow about that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet to find hordes of England supporters. Perhaps they are all turning up tommorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well England look a lot better. Weak at times but in attack we almost look like a real team again. I think Wilkinson really helps if nothing else we can bore them to death with penalties now and some decent line kicking.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Quite a flattering result in the end. We didnt look that good in the second half. Some good tries but otherwise we looked a bit crap really.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thankfully last night we didnt drink to much so i feel relatively okay. Made the train with plenty of time to spare. The train is very purple. There is also quite a bit of legroom which makes a change from yesterdays train. There is enough room i dont mind having the window seat. Im normally an aisle man given my size. Does mean i can stare at the french countryside as it rushes pass. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Good try by the USA at the end of the half. They are certainly showing more flair than england did against south africa. I suspect south africa are going to score a lot of points in the second half.&lt;br/&gt; Good atmosphere at the match.  the train journey was long so it best be a good match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the states lost by a lot but attacked a lot more than england did against the south africans. South africa still look awesome. They really do have a chance of winning the title this time round.&lt;/p&gt;
