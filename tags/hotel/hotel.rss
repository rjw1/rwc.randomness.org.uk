		<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I finished booking my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raileurope.co.uk&quot;&gt;rail tickets&lt;/a&gt; and hotels for the next month. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://booking.com&quot;&gt;booking.com&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accorhotels.com/accorhotels/index.html&quot;&gt;Accor Hotels&lt;/a&gt; website to find some okay deals. Marseille for the quarter finals was the worst. There were no easily findable hotels near the centre of town. Nantes was pretty hard as well booking.com only had one hotel left it would seem but I now have a roof over my head and travel plans for all of the matches I have tickets for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the next month im going to get to know the insides of the Eurostar and the TGVs quite well. Beats flying though. Some of the airplane ticket prices were astronomical already even on the budget airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father is doing most of the world cup in a camper van. I would have joined him but my employers seem to want me to turn up to work.&lt;/p&gt;
