&lt;p&gt;So France are in trouble at half time. France 9-17 Argentina. They havent looked that good as well. Although dad thinks they both look better than England.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong here. Although japan may tire yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im also intrigued by the fijians number 8 at the scrum. He seems to be holding onto his locks and leaning back then pushing forward when they engage. Perhaps it adds to their shove.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Quite dull so far especially when compared to the previous game. Italy look the better side but arnt making the best use of their possession. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well thats not going well. When it was still 10 - 0 we had a chance. That last try was a killer blow I suspect. Although we didnt look as bad as last week and they have only really scored from broken play.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/rjw1/1427998455/in/set-72157601970911630/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1092/1427998455_f5a677653c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well England look a lot better. Weak at times but in attack we almost look like a real team again. I think Wilkinson really helps if nothing else we can bore them to death with penalties now and some decent line kicking.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Good try by the USA at the end of the half. They are certainly showing more flair than england did against south africa. I suspect south africa are going to score a lot of points in the second half.&lt;br/&gt; Good atmosphere at the match.  the train journey was long so it best be a good match.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;We actually played quite well for once. We look like a ruigby team this week. We are unlucky to be trailing. Then again with the one chance australia had they scored a try. Weve had several decent chances but havent made full use of them.&lt;/p&gt;
