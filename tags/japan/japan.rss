		<description>&lt;p&gt;A 30 point win by Fiji. Japan may score a try or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fiji are never that great at the 15 man version of the game they should be able to beat Japan easily. Even with their ringers. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong here. Although japan may tire yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im also intrigued by the fijians number 8 at the scrum. He seems to be holding onto his locks and leaning back then pushing forward when they engage. Perhaps it adds to their shove.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well that was an exciting &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6987627.stm&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. Japan were really quite good and pushed Fiji very hard. The Fijians could have been their own worse enemy at the end there. They had at least 2 chances to kick to touch which they missed.&lt;/p&gt;
