		<description>&lt;p&gt;A 30 point win by Fiji. Japan may score a try or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fiji are never that great at the 15 man version of the game they should be able to beat Japan easily. Even with their ringers. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong here. Although japan may tire yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im also intrigued by the fijians number 8 at the scrum. He seems to be holding onto his locks and leaning back then pushing forward when they engage. Perhaps it adds to their shove.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well that was an exciting &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6987627.stm&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. Japan were really quite good and pushed Fiji very hard. The Fijians could have been their own worse enemy at the end there. They had at least 2 chances to kick to touch which they missed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/rjw1/1517919300/in/set-72157601970911630/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2231/1517919300_dbf2f61249.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given last nights results im tempted to predict a Fijian win. However South Africa have looked the form team in the tournament and this match matters. So I think they will win by 30.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Got distracted by getting back to the station for our train to Arles. South Africa won convincingly in the end but Fiji certainly gave them a fright. The two tries to draw level were fantastic and they were down a man at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
