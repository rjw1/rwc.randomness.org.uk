&lt;p&gt;England looked really bad during this game. We really should have beaten them by an awful lot more points. I was talking to a group of USA fans afterwards who agreed that we really should have been beating them by about 60 points at half time. Although given their performance against tonga today the usa may not be all that bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made it to paris on the eurostar. Finally found my hotel. Sitting at a cafe outside the gare du nord. Having a beer while waiting for dad. &lt;br/&gt;England are going to get thumped i think. That or we sneak by it by 2 points.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well thats not going well. When it was still 10 - 0 we had a chance. That last try was a killer blow I suspect. Although we didnt look as bad as last week and they have only really scored from broken play.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Well that was crap. England looked better but had no penetration. Hopefully jason robinson isnt to badly injured. The south africans looked really good although they only scored from broken play. &lt;br/&gt;the atmosphere at the ground was really good. The stadium is very impressive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well England look a lot better. Weak at times but in attack we almost look like a real team again. I think Wilkinson really helps if nothing else we can bore them to death with penalties now and some decent line kicking.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Quite a flattering result in the end. We didnt look that good in the second half. Some good tries but otherwise we looked a bit crap really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very sunny in Marseille. This is not good for England. So I suspect we will lose. I think Australia will win by 20. If they dont we will win by about 3&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;We actually played quite well for once. We look like a ruigby team this week. We are unlucky to be trailing. Then again with the one chance australia had they scored a try. Weve had several decent chances but havent made full use of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo! We won. Exciting finish. We looked good for once. The aussies scrum was under pressure all match. They wouldnt have been able to contain new zealand in the next round. So they may as well lose this round. Makes the England tournament respectable even if we go out next week.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Just got off the ferry at Boulounge speeding to Paris in the car. We managed to get 2 tickets off a kiwi in London for a not to inflated price. We need a third but were not to fussed. One of us will go and watch it at the eiffel tower. &lt;br/&gt;Dad even managed to find a hotel about 2.5k from stade de france. So its all good. Now to pray for rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... And found another ticket almost instantly again at only 30% markup. Having another beer before we go hunting a cash machine since were down to our last rounds worth of euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere is great here. England to win by 3. It will be a close low scoring game.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Good try by lewsey to start. Weve held them back since. Neither team has taken control yet. Still a tight match. The england fans are a bit quiet. Then again all the aussies and kiwis here are shouting for france as well.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Excuse my french but Fuck Me! What a result. What a game. So tense at the end.  Four more years! At least if we lose the title now we do so in the final.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;So somehow England have made it to the final. South Africa have looked good all tournament. This wont be the beating we got in the pool matches but I still think were going to lose. It will be close though. I think South Africa by&amp;nbsp; 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ideally our forwards step up again and we win by 3 points or so. :)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Close, very close.&amp;nbsp; South Africa were unlucky to not score a try at the end there. England certainly look a lot better than they did in the pool game. We still might do it. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Bugger! well at least we lost our title in the final. South Africa have looked like champs all the way through. I dont think it was a try either. &lt;/p&gt;
