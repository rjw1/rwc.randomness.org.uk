		<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently sitting on a TGV between Paris and Nantes. Its really quite full. I was lucky on the eurostar as I got 2 seats to myself. The connection across Paris was a bit close. It is probably worth prebuying your Metro tickets at the eurostar terminal in london and knowing which metro line you want. In this case line 4 &quot;the pink one&quot; between Gare du Nord and Montparnasse. The walk from the tube to the train is quite long.&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully i can find somewhere to watch tonights crunch match between France and Ireland. I suspect France will win.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Caught the last 20 minutes of this game in a bar full of french supporters. France looked awesome. Obviously the loss to Argentina was the kick in the arse they needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missed the start since I was having a really nice dinner. Post to follow about that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet to find hordes of England supporters. Perhaps they are all turning up tommorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
