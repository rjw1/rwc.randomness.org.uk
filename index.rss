		<description>&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of July I got confirmation that my application for tickets for the rugby world cup in New Zealand was successful. I have tickets for all the England games, all pool games in Christchurch, the Christchurch quarter finals and the bronze final. Tickets for the semis and the final are by ballot nearer the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the match tickets its time to start planning the rest of the trip. My dad has probably already found us accommodation near Christchurch for the duration of the tournament. All I need to start looking for is round the world plane tickets. I intend to make a tour of it. If nothing else I have plans to be at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.renovationsf.org/&quot;&gt;Reno Worldcon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Bugger! well at least we lost our title in the final. South Africa have looked like champs all the way through. I dont think it was a try either. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Close, very close.&amp;nbsp; South Africa were unlucky to not score a try at the end there. England certainly look a lot better than they did in the pool game. We still might do it. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;So somehow England have made it to the final. South Africa have looked good all tournament. This wont be the beating we got in the pool matches but I still think were going to lose. It will be close though. I think South Africa by&amp;nbsp; 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ideally our forwards step up again and we win by 3 points or so. :)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Excuse my french but Fuck Me! What a result. What a game. So tense at the end.  Four more years! At least if we lose the title now we do so in the final.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Good try by lewsey to start. Weve held them back since. Neither team has taken control yet. Still a tight match. The england fans are a bit quiet. Then again all the aussies and kiwis here are shouting for france as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere is great here. England to win by 3. It will be a close low scoring game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... And found another ticket almost instantly again at only 30% markup. Having another beer before we go hunting a cash machine since were down to our last rounds worth of euros. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Just got off the ferry at Boulounge speeding to Paris in the car. We managed to get 2 tickets off a kiwi in London for a not to inflated price. We need a third but were not to fussed. One of us will go and watch it at the eiffel tower. &lt;br/&gt;Dad even managed to find a hotel about 2.5k from stade de france. So its all good. Now to pray for rain.&lt;/p&gt;
